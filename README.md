CodeAlpha_Iris

📌 Project Overview

This project, developed as part of my internship at CodeAlpha, focuses on the classification of iris flowers into three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The analysis is performed using a range of machine learning models on a dataset containing flower measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

⚙️ Tech Stack

This project leverages the following libraries for data processing, analysis, and model building:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🚀 Features

The Iris_Analysis.ipynb notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including:

Data preprocessing and feature scaling.

Training and evaluation of multiple classification models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation using standard metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Visualization of model performance through confusion matrices for each model.

📊 Results

All four machine learning models successfully achieved 

100% accuracy on the test dataset. The confusion matrices further confirm that all flower samples were correctly classified by each model, indicating robust performance.
